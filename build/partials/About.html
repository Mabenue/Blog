      <p>Alex Conway</p>
      <p> I am a motivated, reponsible and adaptable individual. My degree has helped me gain
  an analytical and logical approach to tasks. My current employment at Delphi has
  helped me develop exceptional time management and organisational skills. I have a
  passion for technology and I am begginning to gain a good level of experience with
  a wide range of technology. I strive to learn someting new from every experience
  because I believe there is always room for self-improvement both personally and
  professionally.
